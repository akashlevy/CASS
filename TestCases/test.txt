#Welcome to Computational Adaptable Stochastic Simulator!
#Instructions for file format
#Ex: CO2+H2O->C6H12O6+O2
#- NO spaces
#- NO > + - * / in molecule name
#- First character of each molecule must be a letter
#- If first character is a number, it will be treated as a coefficient
#- All numbers must be integers
#- Numbers within molecule name are OK
#- Lowercase is OK
#- Output files will be saved in (ReactantName).dat
