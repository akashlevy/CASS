#Welcome to Computational Adaptable Stochastic Simulator!
#Instructions for file format
#Ex: CO2+H2O->C6H12O6+O2
#- NO spaces
#- NO > + - * / in molecule name
#- First character of each molecule must be a letter
#- If first character is a number, it will be treated as a coefficient
#- All numbers must be integers
#- Numbers within molecule name are OK
#- Lowercase is OK
#- Output files will be saved in (ReactantName).dat

***Replace the quantities below with your reactions and rate constants:
Reactions
12air + glucose -> 6water + 6co2 [.01]
air + 2h2 -> 2water [.005]
2water + 3sucrose -> air + co2 [.03]
sucrose + co2 -> glucose [.01]
end

***Replace the quantities below with reactant names and their corresponding initial molecule count:
Molecule Count of Reactants
water = 1.23e+10
air = 1.23e+10
glucose = 1.23e+10
h2 = = 1.23e+10
co2 = 10000
sucrose = 2.5e+8
end

Optional Parameters ***Enter "time"
duration=(Insert Duration [secs]) default = 100
max_iterations=(Insert Max Number of Iterations) default = 1000000
output_freq=(Insert Print Output Frequency [print every "n" iterations]) default = 10000
Plot sucrose vs. glucose, h2 vs. air, water vs. time
end
