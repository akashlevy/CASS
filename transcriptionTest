#Welcome to Computational Adaptable Stochastic Simulator!
#Instructions for file format
#Ex: CO2+H2O->C6H12O6+O2
#- NO spaces
#- NO > + - * / in molecule name
#- First character of each molecule must be a letter
#- If first character is a number, it will be treated as a coefficient
#- All numbers must be integers
#- Numbers within molecule name are OK
#- Lowercase is OK
#- Output files will be saved in (ReactantName).dat

***Replace the quantities below with your reactions and rate constants:
Reactions
D -> D + M [.01]
M -> M + P [.1154]
M -> [.00577]
P -> [.0001925]
end

***Replace the quantities below with reactant names and their corresponding initial molecule count:
Molecule Count of Reactants (for large numbers, enter in format 1.23e+45)
P=0
D=1
M=0
end

Optional Parameters ***Enter "time"
duration=(Insert Duration [secs]) default = 1000000
max_iterations=(Insert Max Number of Iterations) default = 10000000
output_freq=(Insert Print Output Frequency [print every "n" iterations]) default = 10000
Plot P vs. time
end
