#Welcome to Computational Adaptable Stochastic Simulator!
#Instructions for file format
#Ex: CO2+H2O->C6H12O6+O2
#- NO spaces
#- NO > + - * / in molecule name
#- First character of each molecule must be a letter
#- If first character is a number, it will be treated as a coefficient
#- All numbers must be integers
#- Numbers within molecule name are OK
#- Lowercase is OK
#- Save this file in the same folder as the ----.py
#- Output files will be saved in (ReactantName).dat

***Replace the quantities below with your reactions and rate constants:
Reactions
R->2R [10]
R+W->2W [.01]
W-> [10]
end

***Replace the quantities below with reactant names and their corresponding initial molecule count:
Molecule Count of Reactants
R = 2000
W = 1000
end

Optional Parameters
duration=(Insert Duration [secs]) default = 10
max_iterations=(Insert Max Number of Iterations) default = 100000
output_freq=(Insert Print Output Frequency [print every "n" iterations]) default = 1000
Plot R vs. W, W vs. R
end
