#Welcome to Computational Adaptable Stochastic Simulator!
#Instructions for file format
#Ex: CO2+H2O->C6H12O6+O2
#- NO spaces
#- NO > + - * / in molecule name
#- First character of each molecule must be a letter
#- If first character is a number, it will be treated as a coefficient
#- All numbers must be integers
#- Numbers within molecule name are OK
#- Lowercase is OK
#- Output files will be saved in (ReactantName).dat

***Replace the quantities below with your reactions and rate constants:
Reactions
A + B -> C [.005]
C -> A + B [.005]
end

***Replace the quantities below with reactant names and their corresponding initial molecule count:
Molecule Count of Reactants
A = 250
B = 250
C = 500
end

Optional Parameters ***Enter "time"
duration=(Insert Duration [secs]) default = 30
max_iterations=(Insert Max Number of Iterations) default = 1000000
output_freq=(Insert Print Output Frequency [print every "n" iterations]) default = 1000
Plot A vs. B, B vs. C, A vs. time, C vs. time
end
